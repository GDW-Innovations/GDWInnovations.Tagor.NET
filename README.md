The Tagor.NET component implements the Tagor API v2.0 API and provides a generated client component. The component requires a Tagor server and API key to connect to. 

The code (in the TagorClient folder) is entirely generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
Recreate this using this command
```
openapi-generator-cli generate -i TagorApi.yaml -g csharp -o TagorClient --additional-properties=packageName=TagorClient
```

The documentation for the api is very complete and can be found under `TagorClient/docs`
